 turned approximately to the north. Some audio of aurora QSOs going on in north Europe: <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/10783507">http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/10783507</a>

<tr><th scope="row" id="velocity-factor">Velocity factor</th><td>The speed of radio waves is about 300 000 km/s in free space. In a conducting medium the speed is much slower (in an antenna wire about 95% of the free space speed). When calculating antenna dimensions or cutting coaxial cable to some specific use case where length matters you need to take the velocity factor into account. If you are for example calculating a length for a wire dipole, you will get the half-wavelength by dividing 150 with the frequency in MHz. You however still need to take the velocity factor into account by multiplying the result with 0.95 (the 95% mentioned above).</td></tr>

<tr><th scope="row" id="wavelength">Wavelength</th><td>Wavelength is the length of one complete cycle of the electromagnetic wave leaving from the antenna. On 27 MHz this is about 11 meters. Wavelength is important when calculating antenna lengths. Wavelength in a vacuum can be calculated with the formula 300 / MHz. The result is the wavelength in meters. When calculating antenna lengths you also have to take into account the <a href="#velocity-factor">velocity factor</a> of the antenna material.</td></tr>
