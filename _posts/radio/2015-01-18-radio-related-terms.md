    <tr><td>Aurora</td><td>Radio aurora, propagation mode that is associated with northern lights (aurora borealis in the northern hemisphere and aurora australis in the southern hemisphere).
 Audio of the stations coming via auroral backscatter sound often distorted because there is several reflecting spots in an aurora and those are also in a constant motion.
 It's possible to make aurora QSOs on SSB but on FM the sound of the station coming via aurora is too distorted. When making QSOs via radio aurora antennas are usually
 turned approximately to north. Some audio of aurora QSOs going on in north Europe: <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/10783507">http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/10783507</a>

        Sometimes DX-peditions use a frequency range instead of a single frequency, for example 27.600&ndash;27.610. In this case the DX-pedition operator will be listening
        on every frequency inside this range step by step (27.600, 27.601, 27.602 etc.). This gives those trying to work the DX-pedition a better chance
